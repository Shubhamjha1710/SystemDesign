Facade Design Pattern is a Structural pattern that simplifies interactions with complex subsystems.
It provides a unified, easy-to-use interface to the complex system made up of multiple classes for
clients and promoting cleaner, more maintainable code.
It hides complexity and exposes only what the client actually needs.
Client ----interacts---->  Intermediator (Facade interface)  --------> interacts with complex system.


Real life usage
1.Video Streaming Platform: Provide a unified interface for video encoding, buffering and playback.
2.Banking Systems: Offers easy access to complex operations like fund transfers and balance inquiries.


Use of Facade Method Design Pattern
1.Simplifying Complex External Systems: Encapsulate database handling and hides API complexity.
2.Layering Subsystems: Defines clear boundaries and offers simplified subsystem interfaces.
3. Protecting Clients from Unstable Systems: Maintains a stable interface and decouples clients
from external changes.


Components of Facade Pattern
1. Subsystem Classes: Complex, detailed system parts (e.g., DVDPlayer, Projector, SoundSystem)
2. Facade: Provides a simple interface to interact with all subsystems
3. Client: Uses the Facade instead of dealing with subsystems directly

Client communicate with the subsystem by sending requests to Facade, which forwarded by facade
to appropriate subsystem objects.


Lets take a example of theater where there are multiple subsystem like sound system, projector and
dvd player works to provide theater experience. So here we will implement a facade interface which
handle all this interaction we only provide this interface a move name and volume number.
