Problem statement: Design an elevator system for a building with multiple floors with only
x elevators cars. Design this system such that wait time for each floor guest should not be
too large or small


Requirements Gathering
1. There is a set of x elevators in building
2. There is a set of n floors in the building (n > 2*x)
3. All floors should have elevator control panel (buttons for direction up/down, display to
show elevator's floor no with direction)
4. There should control panel inside elevator (floor no button, open/close door, ring alarm,
display to show elevator's floor no  direction of movement)
5. There should be constraint like weight and minimum person count on elevator.
5. A person can enter the elevator only when it is stopped and the doors are open.
6. A dispatcher algorithm to enures that there should be minimum response time.
7. A controller should be responsible for gathering requests from inside and outside
elevator from buttons on both internal and external sides. The system shall assign the most
suitable elevator based on its current location and trajectory.
8. Every elevator should have a set of serving floors like first x/2 elevator for n/2 and next
x/2 for upper n/2 floors.
9. We should maintain the top floor and the lowest floor number.

Low Level Designing
Now using above requirements we can identify following classes
1. Building
2. Elevator
3. Floor
4. Door
5. Control panel (two types external and internal we can use inheritance)
6. Display
7. Controller or dispatcher
8. Main Class which is used to run the application


Flow:
1. There is main method which will create complete architecture like Building.
2. This Building will contain instance variable like no of elevators and no of floors. Contain
the reference of controller.
3. This controller contains the references of elevators and floors. Receives and processes the
request from floor to stop the elevator. Then decide the most suitable elevator and delicate the
request to this elevator. There should be only one instance of controller (singleton class)
4. Elevator serves two types of request i.e request from person inside the elevator and from the
person outside elevator (via controller) and serves the both types of request by halting at floor.
There is multiple scheduling strategy which an elevator should opt to improve response time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Design Patterns
1. Observer design pattern: To send the request / notification from floor to elevator.
2. Strategy design pattern: To opt multiple scheduling strategy at runtime.
3. Singleton design pattern: To make the centralized controller system.
